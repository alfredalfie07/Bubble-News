                                    <p>The SURF token is an asset converted from SURF points. SURF points can be generated by clicking the SURF button once a day. The more friends you have, the higher the production volume. You can use the generated SURF points to purchase surfboard items or transfer them to others in a 1:1 conversion to SURF tokens.</p>

Surfboard items have different BAY point production rates based on their grades. The acquired BAY points can be converted to BAY tokens at each conversion point, proportional to the individual's BAY point ratio compared to the total planned BAY points for conversion. BAY tokens can be transferred or traded with others.</p>

                        <p>Marina Protocol avoids complex wallet usage, encouraging users to use the user-friendly non-custodial wallet, such as MetaMask, to onboard into Web 3.0. Users, when Marina Protocol selects the mainnet for token issuance, simply need to paste the wallet address based on that mainnet. Marina Protocol will convert and transfer the earned points into tokens to the provided wallet address at specified intervals.</p>
                        <p>However, if multiple accounts share one wallet address, the user may be considered as having multiple accounts, and a verification process may be required. Please be cautious in your usage.</p>

                        <p>SURF Tokens can be obtained by converting SURF Points. SURF Points can be obtained by clicking the SURF icon once every 24 hours when the SURF is complete. To accelerate the acquisition of SURF Points, you can watch ads for an additional 100% when clicking the SURF icon or invite friends. Having more friends can greatly help in obtaining more SURF Points. You can check the method to accelerate efficiency by inviting friends in the 'Refer New Surfers' tab below.</p>

When you directly invite a friend, you'll receive an additional boost of 0.2 pSURF/1h from each friend, and when that friend invites someone, you'll get an extra boost of 0.05 pSURF/1h from each of their referrals. Friends who were referred by you will receive a continuous boost of 0.25 pSURF/1h from the initial sign-up. The earned SURF Points can be used to purchase surfboard NFTs that grant BAY Points, so mine diligently!</p>

                        <p>BAY Tokens can be obtained by converting BAY Points, which are earned through surfboard NFT staking. Surfboard NFTs come in various grades, each producing BAY Points at different efficiencies. The accumulated BAY Points are then converted each week based on the individual's proportion of points to the total stake at the tokenization checkpoint. Want more BAY Tokens? Invite friends, diligently earn SURF Points, and mint high-grade surfboard NFTs for staking.</p>

                        <p>All users focus on producing SURF points. These SURF points can be converted one-to-one into SURF tokens or used to mint surfing board NFTs within the app at each tokenization point. The reason for supporting SURF tokens is to ensure no constraints on user-to-user transfers and trades, and that a user's assets are accessible only by the user. Surfboards NFTs, minted with SURF points, can be wrapped into NFTs for trading on NFT exchanges or staked within the app to produce BAY points. Produced BAY points are converted into BAY tokens at each tokenization point based on the user's proportion of points relative to the total BAY points. These converted BAY tokens grant decision-making authority in onboarding projects to Marina Protocol, along with user rewards and operational decisions. Furthermore, as a critical asset within Marina Protocol, BAY tokens are planned to be listed on major exchanges.</p>
